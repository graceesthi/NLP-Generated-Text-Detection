We present a method for the generation of Midi files of piano music. The method models the right and left hands using two networks, where the left hand is conditioned on the right hand. This way, the melody is generated before the harmony. The Midi is represented in a way that is invariant to the musical scale, and the melody is represented, for the purpose of conditioning the harmony, by the content of each bar, viewed as a chord. Finally, notes are added randomly, based on this chord representation, in order to enrich the generated audio. Our experiments show a significant improvement over the state of the art for training on such datasets, and demonstrate the contribution of each of the novel components.
