Cybersecurity has been a concern for quite a while now. In the latest years, cyberattacks have been increasing in size and complexity, fueled by sig- nificant advances in technology. Nowadays, there is an unavoidable necessity of protecting systems and data crucial for business continuity. Hence, many in- trusion detection systems have been created in an attempt to mitigate these threats and contribute to a timelier detection. This work proposes a novel, and highly effective, method to detect cyber threats using two types of cross-language models, a binary or cross-domain model, and a multi- language model. The system combines the features of both cross-language and multi- language models to identify the targets of cyber attacks and their actions.
