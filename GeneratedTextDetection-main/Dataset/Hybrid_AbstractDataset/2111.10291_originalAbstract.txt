A plethora of attack methods have been proposed to gener- ate adversarial examples, among which the iterative methods have been demonstrated the ability to find a strong attack. However, the computation of an adversarial perturbation for a new data point requires solving a time-consuming optimiza- tion problem from scratch. To generate a stronger attack, it normally requires updating a data point with more iterations. In this paper, we show the existence of a meta adversarial perturbation (MAP), a better initialization that causes natu- ral images to be misclassified with high probability after be- ing updated through only a one-step gradient ascent update, and propose an algorithm for computing such perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments, and the empirical results demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep neural networks are vulnerable to meta perturbations. We further show that these perturbations are not only image-agnostic, but also model- agnostic, as a single perturbation generalizes well across un- seen data points and different neural network architectures.
