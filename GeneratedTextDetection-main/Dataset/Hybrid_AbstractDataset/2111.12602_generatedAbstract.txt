Models of human motion commonly focus either on tra- jectory prediction or action classification but rarely both. The marked heterogeneity and intricate compositionality of human motion render each task vulnerable to the data degradation and distributional shift common to real-world scenarios. A sufficiently expressive generative model of ac- tion could in theory enable data conditioning and distribu- tional resilience within a unified framework applicable to both tasks. Here we propose an approach that incorporates a high level of generative model fusion as well as an additional layer of data-driven generative models. Our approach also incorporates a novel and useful component for classification, which is the extraction of sentence sequences using machine translation ( MMT). In this work, we integrate these approaches and an iterative approach that achieves performance comparable to the previous models. Trained and eval- uated on H3.6M and the largest collection of open source human motion data, AMASS, we show HG-VAE can facil- itate downstream discriminative learning better than base- line models.
