Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that explains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit for- mation, dopaminergic discharge and curiosity. However, recent im- plementations suffer from an exponential (space and time) com- plexity class when computing the prior over all the possible policies up to the time horizon. Fountas et al. (2020) used Monte Carlo tree search to address this problem, leading to very good results in two different tasks. Additionally, Champion et al. (2021a) pro- posed a tree search approach based on structure learning. This was enabled by the development of a variational message passing ap- proach to active inference (Champion et al., 2021b), which enables compositional construction of Bayesian networks for active infer- ence. However, this message passing tree search approach, which we call branching-time active inference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically. In this paper, we present an experimental study of the approach (Champion et al., 2021a) in the context of a maze solving agent. In this context, we show that both improved prior preferences and deeper search help mitigate the vulnerability to lo- cal minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard active inference (AI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small graphs, both BTAI and AI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AI exhibits an exponential (space) complexity class, making the ap- proach intractable. However, BTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently, successfully scaling to larger graphs.
