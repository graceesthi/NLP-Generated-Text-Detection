Cybersecurity has been a concern for quite a while now. In the latest years, cyberattacks have been increasing in size and complexity, fueled by sig- nificant advances in technology. Nowadays, there is an unavoidable necessity of protecting systems and data crucial for business continuity. Hence, many in- trusion detection systems have been created in an attempt to mitigate these threats and contribute to a timelier detection. This work proposes an interpreta- ble and explainable hybrid intrusion detection system, which makes use of arti- ficial intelligence methods to achieve better and more long-lasting security. The system combines experts’ written rules and dynamic knowledge continuously generated by a decision tree algorithm as new shreds of evidence emerge from network activity.
