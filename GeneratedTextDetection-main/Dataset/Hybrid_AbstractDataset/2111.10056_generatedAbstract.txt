Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a combination of medical artificial intelligence and popular VQA challenges. Given a medical image and a clinically relevant question in natural language, the medical VQA system is expected to predict a plausible and convincing answer. Although the general-domain VQA has been extensively studied, the medical VQA still needs specific investigation and exploration due to its task features. In the first part of this survey, we propose to apply the knowledge learned from the medical images to the VQA task to determine a simple, effective and cost effective way to answer questions that are of interest in biomedical image identification. In the second part, we propose a new approach for biomedical image identification based on the knowledge learned from the VQA images and use it to produce a publicly available and validated medical image search toolkit.
