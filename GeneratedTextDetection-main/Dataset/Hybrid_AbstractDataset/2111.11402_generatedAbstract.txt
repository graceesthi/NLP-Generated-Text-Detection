An n-queens configuration is a placement of n mutually non-attacking queens on an n × n chessboard. The n-queens completion problem, introduced by Nauck in 1850, is to decide whether a given partial configuration can be completed to an n-queens configuration. In this paper, we use N-queens completion of the same configuration to find out whether a particular partial configuration can be completed to the n-queens configuration. We show that any placement of at most n/60 mutually non-attacking queens can be completed. We also provide partial configurations of roughly n/4 queens that cannot be completed, and formulate a number of interesting problems. Our proofs connect the queens problem to rainbow matchings in bipartite graphs and use probabilistic arguments together with linear programming duality.
