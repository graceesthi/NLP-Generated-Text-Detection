We introduce a voting model with multi-agent ranked delegations. This model generalises liquid democracy in two aspects: first, an agent’s delega- tion can use the votes of multiple other agents to determine their own—for instance, an agent’s vote may correspond to the majority outcome of the votes of a trusted group of agents; second, agents can submit a ranking over multiple delegations, so that a backup delegation can be used when their preferred delegations are involved in cycles. The main focus of this paper is the study of unravelling procedures that transform the delegation ballots received from the agents into a profile of direct votes, from which a winning alternative can then be determined by using a standard voting rule. We pro- pose and study six such unravelling procedures, two based on optimisation and four using a greedy approach. We study both algorithmic and axiomatic properties, as well as related computational complexity problems of our un- ravelling procedures for different restrictions on the types of ballots that the agents can submit.
