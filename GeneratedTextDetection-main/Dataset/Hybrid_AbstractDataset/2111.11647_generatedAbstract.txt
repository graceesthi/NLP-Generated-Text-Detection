We report a bio-inspired framework for training a neural network through rein- forcement learning to induce high level functions within the network. Based on the interpretation that animals have gained their cognitive functions such as object recognition — without ever being specifically trained for — as a result of max- imizing their fitness to the environment, we place our agent in an environment where developing certain functions may facilitate decision making. The exper- imental results show that a model that utilizes these neural parameters to maximize the degree of knowledge required to produce neural network outperforms a model that only uses these parameters to achieve desired features.
