Time-series data is generated ubiquitously from Internet- of-Things (IoT) infrastructure, connected and wearable devices, remote sensing, autonomous driving research and, audio-video communications, in enormous volumes. This paper investigates the potential of unsuper- vised representation learning for these time-series. In this paper, we use a novel data transformation along with novel unsupervised learning regime to transfer the learning from other domains to time-series where the for- mer have extensive models heavily trained on very large labelled datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach through time-series clustering.
