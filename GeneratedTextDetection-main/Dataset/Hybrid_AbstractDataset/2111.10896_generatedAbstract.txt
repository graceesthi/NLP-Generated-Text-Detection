Prominent approaches to belief revision prescribe the adop- tion of a new belief that is as close as possible to the prior belief, in a process that, even in the standard case, can be described as attempting to minimize surprise. Here we propose an alternate formulation of that approach, which combines the accuracy of a prior belief with the accuracy of a prior belief, in a manner that minimizes surprise. We characterize the surprise minimization re- vision operator thus defined using a set of intuitive rationality postulates in the AGM mould, along the way obtaining rep- resentation results for other existing revision operators in the literature, such as the Dalal operator and a recently introduced distance-based min-max operator.
