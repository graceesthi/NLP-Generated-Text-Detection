Inspired by the ”Cognitive Hour-glass” model presented in [1], we propose a new framework for developing cognitive architectures aimed at cognitive robotics. The purpose of the proposed framework is foremost to ease the develop- ment of cognitive architectures by encouraging and mitigating cooperation and re-use of existing results. This is done by proposing a framework dividing the development of cognitive architectures into a series of layers that can be considered partly in isolation, and some of which directly relate to other research fields. Finally, we give introductions to and review some topics essential to the proposed framework.
