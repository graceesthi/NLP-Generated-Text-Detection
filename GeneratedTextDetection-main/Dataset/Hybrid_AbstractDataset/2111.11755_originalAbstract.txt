Most neural text-to-speech (TTS) models require ⟨speech, transcript⟩ paired data from the desired speaker for high-quality speech synthesis, which limits the us- age of large amounts of untranscribed data for training. In this work, we present Guided-TTS, a high-quality TTS model that learns to generate speech from un- transcribed speech data. Guided-TTS combines an unconditional diffusion prob- abilistic model with a separately trained phoneme classifier for text-to-speech. By modeling the unconditional distribution for speech, our model can utilize the untranscribed data for training. For text-to-speech synthesis, we guide the gener- ative process of the unconditional DDPM via phoneme classification to produce mel-spectrograms from the conditional distribution given transcript. We show that Guided-TTS achieves comparable performance with the existing methods with- out any transcript for LJSpeech. Our results further show that a single speaker- dependent phoneme classifier trained on multispeaker large-scale data can guide unconditional DDPMs for various speakers to perform TTS.
