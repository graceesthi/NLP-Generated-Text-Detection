Optimization problems are crucial in artificial in- telligence. Optimization algorithms are generally used to adjust the performance of artificial intelligence models to minimize the error of mapping inputs to outputs. Current evaluation methods on optimization algorithms generally consider the performance in terms of quality. However, not all optimization algorithms for all test cases are evaluated equal from quality, the computation time should be also considered for optimization tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different optimization algorithms that focus on the same task in three different domains: Language Processing, Speech and Language Understanding , and Inception Processing. We select the well-known optimization algorithms (Bayesian optimization and evolutionary algorithms) and evaluate them on the benchmark test functions in terms of quality and computation time. The results show that BO is suitable to be applied in the optimization tasks that are needed to obtain desired quality in the limited function evaluations, and the EAs are suitable to search the optimal of the tasks that are allowed to find the optimal solution with enough function evaluations. This paper provides the recommendation to select suitable optimization algorithms for optimization problems with different numbers of function evaluations, which contributes to the efficiency that obtains the desired quality with less computation time for optimization problems.
