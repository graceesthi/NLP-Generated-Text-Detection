For Artificial Intelligence to have a greater impact in biology and medicine, it is crucial that recommendations are both accurate and transparent. In other domains, a neurosym- bolic approach of multi-hop reasoning on knowl- edge graphs has been shown to produce trans- parent explanations. However, there is a lack of research applying it to complex biomedical datasets and problems. In this paper, we develop an experimental setup that allows the creation of multi-hop hypotheses from a structured biomedical dataset. The proposed experiment also includes the analysis of multiple language domains and is expected to have a strong effect on biomedical sentiment analysis. The ap- proach is found to outperform the best baselines by 21.7% on average whilst producing novel, bi- ologically relevant explanations.
