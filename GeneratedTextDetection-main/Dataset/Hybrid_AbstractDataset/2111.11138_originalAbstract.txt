Engagement in Human-Machine Interaction is the process by which entities participating in the interaction establish, maintain, and end their per- ceived connection. It is essential to monitor the engagement state of patients in various AI-based healthcare paradigms. This includes medical conditions that alter social behavior such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Engagement is a multifaceted construct which is composed of behavioral, emotional, and mental components. Previous research has neglected the multi-faceted nature of engagement. In this paper, a system is presented to distinguish these facets using contextual and relational fea- tures. This can facilitate further fine-grained analysis. Several machine learning classifiers including traditional and deep learning models are compared for this task. A highest accuracy of 74.57% with an F-Score and mean absolute error of 0.74 and 0.23 respectively was obtained on a balanced dataset of 22242 instances with neural network-based classification.
