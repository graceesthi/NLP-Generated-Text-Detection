Time-series data is generated ubiquitously from Internet- of-Things (IoT) infrastructure, connected and wearable devices, remote sensing, autonomous driving research and, audio-video communications, in enormous volumes. This paper investigates the potential of unsuper- vised representation learning for these time-series. In this paper, we extend the existing knowledge base with a simple and fast unsupervised machine learning approach, using a large number of labeled datasets and a well -trained corpus to model time-series. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach through time-series clustering.
