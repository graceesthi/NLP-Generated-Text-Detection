This paper presents an autoencoder based unsupervised ap- proach to identify anomaly in an industrial machine using sounds produced by the machine. The proposed framework is trained using log-melspectrogram representations of the sound signal. In classification, our hypothesis is that the reconstruction error computed for an abnormal machine is larger than that of the a normal machine, since only nor- mal machine sounds are being used to train the autoencoder. A threshold is chosen to discriminate between normal and abnormal machines. However, the threshold changes as sur- rounding conditions vary. To select an appropriate threshold irrespective of the surrounding, we propose a scene classi- fication framework, which can classify the underlying sur- rounding. Hence, the threshold can be selected adaptively irrespective of the surrounding. The experiment evaluation is performed on MIMII dataset for industrial machines namely fan, pump, valve and slide rail. Our experiment analysis shows that utilizing adaptive threshold, the performance im- proves significantly as that obtained using the fixed threshold computed for a given surrounding only.
