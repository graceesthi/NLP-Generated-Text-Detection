In recent years, image-based biological assays have steadily be- come high-throughput, sparking a need for fast automated methods to extract biologically-meaningful information from hundreds of thousands of images. Tak- ing inspiration from the success of ImageNet, we curate CytoImageNet, a large- scale dataset of openly-sourced and weakly-labeled microscopy images (890K images, 894 classes). Pretraining on CytoImageNet yields features that are com- petitive to ImageNet features on downstream microscopy classification tasks. We show evidence that CytoImageNet features capture information not avail- able in ImageNet-trained features. The dataset is made available at https: //www.kaggle.com/stanleyhua/cytoimagenet.
