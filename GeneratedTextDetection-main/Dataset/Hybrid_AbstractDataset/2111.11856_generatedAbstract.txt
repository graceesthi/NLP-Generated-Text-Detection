Autonomous surveillance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed to observe the streets of the city for any suspicious activities. This paper utilizes surveillance UAVs for the purpose of detecting the presence of a fire in the streets. An extensive database is collected from UAV surveillance drones. With the aid of artificial intelligence (AI), fire stations can swiftly identify the presence of a fire emerging in the neighborhood. Spatio-temporal split learning is applied to this scenario to pre- serve privacy and globally train a fire classification model. Fires are hazardous natural disasters that can spread very quickly. Swift identification of fire is required to deploy firefighters to the scene. In order to do this, strong communication between the UAV and the central server where the deep learning process occurs is required. Improving communication resilience is integral to enhancing a safe experience on the roads. Therefore, this paper explores the effects of building on the knowledge base of UAV surveillance systems by introducing a new method for detecting the presence of fires in a neighborhood.
