Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be widely used to diagnose chronic diseases so that necessary precautionary treatment can be done in critical time. Diabetes Mellitus which is one of the major diseases can be easily diagnosed by several Machine Learning algorithms. Early stage diagnosis is crucial to prevent dangerous consequences. In this paper , we propose the first Artificial Intelligence based Modeling of Diabetes Mellitus, the first version of which is based on a real patient (an actual diabetic). The Modeling is based on the Modeling Framework which implements the algorithm described by (Section 5), and implements the algorithms defined by (Section 6) with minimal modification. As per the experimental results obtained,  the model is an intelligent solution which outperforms a typical machine learning model in performance and efficiency.
