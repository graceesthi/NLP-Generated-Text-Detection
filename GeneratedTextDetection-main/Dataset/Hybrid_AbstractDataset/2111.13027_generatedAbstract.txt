Inspired by the ”Cognitive Hour-glass” model presented in [1], we propose a new framework for developing cognitive architectures aimed at cognitive robotics. The purpose of the proposed framework is foremost to ease the develop- ment of cognitive architectures by encouraging and mitigating cooperation and re-use of existing results. This is done by introducing a new set of neural network architectures to the framework and applying them to the context of task development. Finally, we give introductions to and review some topics essential to the proposed framework.
