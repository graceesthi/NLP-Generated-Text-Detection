Our brain consists of biological neurons encoding information through accurate spike timing, yet both the architecture and learning rules of our brain remain largely unknown. Comparing to the recent development of backpropagation-based (BP-based) methods that are able to train spiking neural networks (SNNs) with high accuracy, biologically plausible methods are still in their infancy. In this work, we wish to answer the question of whether it is possible to attain compara- ble accuracy of SNNs trained by BP-based rules with bio-plausible mechanisms. We propose a novel technique to extract information from SNNs  by introducing a new layer of pre-trained acoustic models for detecting and inferring natural language errors. With two types of cells and four types of synaptic connections, the proposed local microcircuit ar- chitecture can compute and propagate error signals through local feedback con- nections and support training of multi-layers SNNs with a globally defined spik- ing error function. Under our microcircuit architecture, we employ the Spike- Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) rule operating in local compartments to up- date synaptic weights and achieve supervised learning in a biologically plausi- ble manner. Finally, We interpret the proposed framework from an optimization point of view and show the equivalence between it and the BP-based rules un- der a special circumstance. Our experiments show that the proposed framework demonstrates learning accuracy comparable to BP-based rules and may provide new insights on how learning is orchestrated in biological systems.
