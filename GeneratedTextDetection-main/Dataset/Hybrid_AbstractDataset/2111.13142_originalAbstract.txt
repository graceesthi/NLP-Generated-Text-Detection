The increasing importance of resource-efficient pro- duction entails that manufacturing companies have to create a more dynamic production environment, with flexible manufac- turing machines and processes. To fully utilize this potential of dynamic manufacturing through automatic production planning, formal skill descriptions of the machines are essential. How- ever, generating those skill descriptions in a manual fashion is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain-knowledge. In this contribution an ontology-based semi-automatic skill description system that utilizes production logs and industrial ontologies through inductive logic programming is introduced and benefits and drawbacks of the proposed solution are evaluated.
