How to evaluate the importance of nodes is essential in research of complex network. There are many methods proposed for solving this problem, but they still have room to be improved. In this paper, a new approach called local volume information dimension is proposed. In this method, the node-level information dimension is used to define the attention-response relationship between nodes in a graph. The information within the certain distance is described by the information entropy. Compared to other methods, the proposed method considers the information of the nodes from different distances more comprehensively. For the purpose of showing the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments on real-world networks are implemented. Promising results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
