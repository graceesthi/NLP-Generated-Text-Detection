Although artificial intelligence (AI) is solving real-world challenges and transforming industries, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions in a responsible way. Many AI ethics principles and guidelines for responsible AI have been recently issued by governments, organisations, and enterprises. However, these AI ethics principles and guidelines are typically high-level and do not provide concrete guidance on how to design and develop responsible AI systems. To address this shortcoming, we first introduce a detailed review of the current legal framework for legal and legal aspects of human behaviour in legal systems, using data sets from a large corpora of relevant legal literature, and present guidelines to address legal implications of AI. We then propose a template that enables AI ethics principles to be operationalised in the form of concrete patterns and suggest a list of patterns using the newly created template. These patterns provide concrete, operationalised guidance that facilitate the development of responsible AI systems.
