For Artificial Intelligence to have a greater impact in biology and medicine, it is crucial that recommendations are both accurate and transparent. In other domains, a neurosym- bolic approach of multi-hop reasoning on knowl- edge graphs has been shown to produce trans- parent explanations. However, there is a lack of research applying it to complex biomedical datasets and problems. In this paper, the ap- proach is explored for drug discovery to draw solid conclusions on its applicability. For the first time, we systematically apply it to multiple biomedical datasets and recommendation tasks with fair benchmark comparisons. The ap- proach is found to outperform the best baselines by 21.7% on average whilst producing novel, bi- ologically relevant explanations.
