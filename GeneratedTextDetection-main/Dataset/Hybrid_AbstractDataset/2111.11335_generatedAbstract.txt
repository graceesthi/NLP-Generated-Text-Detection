Social network alignment aims at aligning person identities across social networks. Embedding based models have been shown effective for the alignment where the structural proximity preserving objective is typically adopted for the model training. With the observation that “overly-close” user embeddings are unavoidable for such models causing alignment inaccuracy, we propose a new embedding based model with a high precision that is more flexible in the sense that it can incorporate alignment information for training. We further proposed a meta-learning algorithm to guide the updating of the pseudo anchor embeddings during the learning process. The proposed intervention via the use of pseudo anchors and meta-learning allows the learning framework to be applicable to a wide spectrum of network alignment methods. We have incorporated the proposed learning framework into several state-of-the-art models. Our experimental results show that the new model can outperform previous state-of-the-art models by up to 60%, but we do not believe this could be considered an advantage of the proposed embedding model.
