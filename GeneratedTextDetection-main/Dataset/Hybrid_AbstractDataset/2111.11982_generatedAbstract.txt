With the growing popularity and ease of access to the internet, the problem of online rumors is escalating. People are relying on social media to gain information readily but fall prey to false information. There is a lack of credibility assessment techniques for online posts to identify rumors as soon as they arrive. Existing studies have formulated several mechanisms to combat online rumors by developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The literature so far provides supervised frameworks for rumor classification that rely on huge training datasets. However, in the online scenario where supervised learning is exigent, dynamic rumor identification becomes difficult. Early detection of online rumors is a challenging task, and studies relating to them are relatively few. It is the need of the hour to identify rumors as soon as they appear online. This work proposes a novel approach to identify false reports using a networked approach that combines an embedding layer of the source word, the target word, and a sub-layer, which takes into account multiple word embeddings. The proposed architecture outperforms several existing baselines and performs better than several supervised techniques. The proposed method, being lightweight, simple, and robust, offers the suitability of being adopted as a tool for online rumor identification.
