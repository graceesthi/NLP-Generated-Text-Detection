This paper considers cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, focus- ing on emergent communication in settings where multiple pairs of independent learners interact at varying frequencies. In this context, multiple distinct and in- compatible languages can emerge. When an agent encounters a speaker of an alternative language, there is a requirement for a period of adaptation before they can efficiently converse. This adaptation results in the emergence of a new language and the forgetting of the previous language. In principle, this is an example of the Catastrophic Forgetting problem which can be mitigated by enabling the agents to learn and maintain multiple languages. We take inspiration from the Continual Learning literature and equip our agents with multi-headed neural networks which enable our agents to be multi-lingual. Our method improves the performance of multiple language learning methods by allowing them to adapt to a diverse vocabulary of language pairs, thereby making them possible to learn more languages independently.
