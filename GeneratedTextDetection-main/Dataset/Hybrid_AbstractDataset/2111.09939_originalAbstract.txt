Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be widely used to diagnose chronic diseases so that necessary precautionary treatment can be done in critical time. Diabetes Mellitus which is one of the major diseases can be easily diagnosed by several Machine Learning algorithms. Early stage diagnosis is crucial to prevent dangerous consequences. In this paper we have made a comparative analysis of several machine learning algorithms viz. Random Forest, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Networks, K – Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost along with feature attribution using SHAP to identify the most important feature in predicting the diabetes on a dataset collected from Sylhet Hospital. As per the experimental results obtained, the Random Forest algorithm has outperformed all the other algorithms with an accuracy of 99% on this particular dataset.
