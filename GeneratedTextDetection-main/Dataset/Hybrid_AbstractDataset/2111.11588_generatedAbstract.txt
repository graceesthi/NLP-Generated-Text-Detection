PDDL+ is an extension of PDDL2.1 which incorporates fully-featured autonomous processes and allows for better modelling of mixed discrete-continuous domains. Unlike PDDL2.1, PDDL+ lacks a logical semantics, relying instead on state-transitional semantics enriched with hybrid automata semantics for the continuous states. This complex semantics makes analysis and comparisons to other action formalisms difficult. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an approach that allows to better model the discrete domains without any ontology transition. The kinship between PDDL+ and hybrid automata allows us to develop a direct mapping between PDDL+ and situation calculus, thereby supplying PDDL+ with a logical semantics and the situation calculus with a modern way of representing autonomous processes. We outline the potential benefits of the mapping by suggesting a new approach to effective planning in PDDL+.
