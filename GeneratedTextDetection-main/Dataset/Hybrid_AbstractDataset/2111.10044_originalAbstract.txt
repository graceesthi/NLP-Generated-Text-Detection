The design or simulation analysis of special equipment products must follow the national standards, and hence it may be necessary to repeatedly consult the contents of the standards in the design process. However, it is difficult for the traditional question answering system based on keyword retrieval to give accurate answers to technical questions. Therefore, we use natural language processing techniques to design a question answering system for the decision-making process in pressure vessel design. To solve the problem of insufficient training data for the technology question answering system, we propose a method to generate questions according to a declarative sentence from several different dimensions so that multiple question-answer pairs can be obtained from a declarative sentence. In addition, we designed an interactive attention model based on a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to improve the performance of the similarity comparison of two question sentences. Finally, the performance of the question answering system was tested on public and technical domain datasets.
