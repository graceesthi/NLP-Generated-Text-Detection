This paper presents an autoencoder based unsupervised ap- proach to identify anomaly in an industrial machine using sounds produced by the machine. The proposed framework is trained using log-melspectrogram representations of the sound signal. In classification, our hypothesis is that the reconstruction error computed for an abnormal machine is larger than that of the a normal machine, since only nor- mal machine sounds are being used to train the autoencoder. A threshold is chosen to discriminate between normal and abnormal machines. However, the threshold changes as sur- rounding conditions vary. To select an appropriate threshold irrespective of the surrounding, we propose a novel technique that can select a threshold based on acoustic clues produced by the sound signal. We exploit two acoustic clues as part of the aut oencoder (the first one is a low frequency note and the second one is a higher frequency note) to select an optimal threshold . The experiment evaluation is performed on MIMII dataset for industrial machines namely fan, pump, valve and slide rail. Our experiment analysis shows that our proposed method achieves a significant improvement in performance over conventional acoustic techniques ( pump, valve and slide rail ) and in a significant manner in the recognition task.
