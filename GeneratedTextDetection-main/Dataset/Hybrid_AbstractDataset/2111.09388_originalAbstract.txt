This work applies Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to optimize diverse auto- mated metrics of translation quality. Au- tomatic metrics in machine translation have made tremendous progress recently. In par- ticular, neural metrics, fine-tuned on human ratings (e.g. BLEURT, or COMET) are out- performing surface metrics in terms of cor- relations to human judgements. Our experi- ments show that the combination of a neural translation model with a neural reference- based metric, BLEURT, results in significant improvement in automatic and human eval- uations. This improvement is obtained with translations different from classical beam- search output: these translations have much lower likelihood and are less favored by sur- face metrics like BLEU.
