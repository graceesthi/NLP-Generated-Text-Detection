Upsampling artifacts are caused by problematic upsampling layers and due to spectral replicas that emerge while upsampling. Also, depending on the used upsampling layer, such artifacts can either be tonal artifacts (additive high-frequency noise) or filtering artifacts (substractive, attenuating some bands). In this work we investigate the potential for detecting low-pass filtering artifacts, and we also investigate the relation between filtering artifacts and noisy lower-pass artifacts. To that end, we bench- mark a large set of upsampling layers for music source separation: different transposed and subpixel convolution setups, different inter- polation upsamplers (including two novel layers based on stretch and sinc interpolation), and different wavelet-based upsamplers (includ- ing a novel learnable wavelet layer). Our results show that filtering artifacts, associated with interpolation upsamplers, are perceptually preferrable, even if they tend to achieve worse objective scores.
