Task and motion planning problems in robotics typically combine symbolic planning over discrete task variables with motion optimization over continuous state and action vari- ables, resulting in trajectories that satisfy the logical constraints imposed on the task variables. Symbolic planning can scale exponentially with the number of task variables, so recent works such as PDDLStream [1] have focused on optimistic planning with an incrementally growing set of objects and facts until a feasible trajectory is found. However, this set is exhaustively and uniformly expanded in a breadth-first manner, regardless of the geometric structure of the problem at hand, which makes long-horizon reasoning with large numbers of objects prohibitively time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a geometrically informed symbolic planner that expands the set of objects and facts in a best-first manner, prioritized by a Graph Neural Network based score that is learned from prior search computations. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of problems and demonstrate an improved ability to plan in large or difficult scenarios. We also apply our algorithm on a 7DOF robotic arm in several block-stacking manipulation tasks.
