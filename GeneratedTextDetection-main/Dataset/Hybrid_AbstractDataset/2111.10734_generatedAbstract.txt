Reliable probability estimation is of crucial importance in many real-world appli- cations where there is inherent uncertainty, such as weather forecasting, medical prognosis, or collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles. Probability-estimation models are trained on observed outcomes (e.g. whether it has rained or not, or whether a patient has died or not), because the ground-truth probabilities of the events of interest are typically unknown. The problem is therefore analogous to binary classification, with the important difference that the objective is to esti- mate probabilities rather than predicting the specific outcome. The goal of this work is to evaluate the best accuracy model for predicting the true event , rather than relying solely on observed outcomes, or simply assuming an approximation that has not been observed. There exist several methods to improve the probabilities generated by these models but they mostly focus on classification problems where the probabilities are related to model uncertainty. In the case of problems with inherent uncertainty, it is challenging to evaluate performance without access to ground-truth probabilities. To address this, we build a synthetic dataset to study and compare different computable metrics. We evaluate existing methods on the synthetic data as well as on three real-world probability estimation tasks, all of which involve inherent uncertainty: precipitation forecasting from radar images, predicting cancer patient survival from histopathology images, and predicting car crashes from dashcam videos. Finally, we also propose a neural model that will be able to learn information from the natural phenomena in the environment, including unseen observations of diseases and life events. The method outperforms existing approaches on most metrics on the simulated as well as real-world data.
