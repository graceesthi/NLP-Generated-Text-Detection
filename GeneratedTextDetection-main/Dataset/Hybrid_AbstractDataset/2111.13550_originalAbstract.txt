Focusing on discriminative zero-shot learning, in this work we introduce a novel mechanism that dynamically augments during training the set of seen classes to produce additional fictitious classes. These fictitious classes diminish the model’s tendency to fixate during training on attribute corre- lations that appear in the training set but will not appear in newly exposed classes. The proposed model is tested within the two formulations of the zero-shot learning framework; namely, gener- alized zero-shot learning (GZSL) and classical zero-shot learning (CZSL). Our model improves the state-of-the-art performance on the CUB dataset and reaches comparable results on the other common datasets, AWA2 and SUN. We investigate the strengths and weaknesses of our method, including the effects of catastrophic forgetting when training an end-to-end zero-shot model.
