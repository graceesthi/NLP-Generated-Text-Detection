This paper proposes a method for calibrating control parameters. Examples of such control parameters are gains of PID controllers, weights of a cost function for optimal control, filter coefficients, the sliding surface of a sliding mode controller, or weights of a neural net- work. Hence, the proposed method can be applied to a wide range of controllers. The method uses a Kalman filter that estimates control parameters rather than the system’s state, using data of closed-loop system operation. The con- trol parameter calibration is driven by a training objective, which encompasses specifications on the performance of the dynamical system. The calibration method tunes the parameters online and robustly, is computationally effi- cient, has low data storage requirements, and is easy to implement making it appealing for many real-time applica- tions. Simulation results show that the method is able to learn control parameters quickly (approximately 24% aver- age decay factor of closed-loop cost), is able to tune the parameters to compensate for disturbances (approximately 29% improvement on tracking precision), and is robust to noise. Further, a simulation study with the high-fidelity ve- hicle simulator CarSim shows that the method can calibrate controllers of a complex dynamical system online, which indicates its applicability to a real-world system.
