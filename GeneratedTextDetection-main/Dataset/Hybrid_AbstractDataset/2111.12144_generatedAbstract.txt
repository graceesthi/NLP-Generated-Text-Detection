The discovery of Behavior Trees (BTs) impacted the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in games, by providing flexible and natural representation of non-player characters (NPCs) logic, manageable by game-designers. Nevertheless, increased pressure on ever better NPCs AI-agents forced complexity of hand- crafted BTs to became barely-tractable and error-prone. On the other hand, while many just-launched on-line games suffer from player-shortage, the existence of AI with a broad-range of capabilities could increase players retention. Therefore, to handle above challenges, recent trends in the field focused on automatic creation of AI-agents: from deep- and reinforcement- learning techniques to combinatorial (constrained) optimization and evolution of BTs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to AI with a broad range of features and an improved development system, and provide some general recommendations for future research directions. To this end, we formulated mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, in which topological and functional changes of the BT are reflected in numerical variables, and constructed a dedicated hybrid-metaheuristic. The performance of presented approach was verified experimentally in a prototype real-time strategy game. Carried out experiments confirmed efficiency and perspectives of presented approach, which is going to be applied in a commercial game.
