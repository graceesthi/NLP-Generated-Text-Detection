Due to the fast processing-speed and robustness it can achieve, skeleton-based action recognition has recently re- ceived the attention of the computer vision community. The recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods have shown commendable performance in learn- ing spatio-temporal representations for skeleton sequence, which use skeleton image as input to a CNN. Since the CNN- based methods mainly encoding the temporal and skele- ton joints simply as rows and columns, respectively, the latent correlation related to all joints may be lost caused by the 2D convolution. To solve this problem, we propose a novel CNN-based method with adversarial training for action recognition. We introduce a two-level domain ad- versarial learning to align the features of skeleton images from different view angles or subjects, respectively, thus fur- ther improve the generalization. We evaluated our proposed method on NTU RGB+D. It achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods and 2.4%, 1.9% ac- curacy gain than the baseline for cross-subject and cross- view.
