The increasing importance of resource-efficient pro- duction entails that manufacturing companies have to create a more dynamic production environment, with flexible manufac- turing machines and processes. To fully utilize this potential of dynamic manufacturing through automatic production planning, formal skill descriptions of the machines are essential. How- ever, generating those skill descriptions in a manual fashion is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain-knowledge. In this contribution to the field of machine learning, we present a method to automatically generate training models from the manual, and discuss how these models can be used to train an automated system on a variety of available domains .
