We report a bio-inspired framework for training a neural network through rein- forcement learning to induce high level functions within the network. Based on the interpretation that animals have gained their cognitive functions such as object recognition — without ever being specifically trained for — as a result of max- imizing their fitness to the environment, we place our agent in an environment where developing certain functions may facilitate decision making. The exper- imental results show that high level functions, such as image classification and hidden variable estimation, can be naturally and simultaneously induced without any pre-training or specifying them.
