Abstract. A lot of manual work goes into identifying a topic for an article. With a large volume of articles, the manual process can be exhausting. Our approach aims to address this issue by automatically extracting topics from the text of large numbers of articles. This approach takes into account the efficiency of the process. Based on existing N-gram analysis, our research examines how often certain words appear in documents in order to support automatic topic extraction. In order to improve efficiency, we apply custom filtering standards to our research. Additionally, delete as many noncritical or irrelevant phrases as possible. In this way, we can ensure we are selecting unique keyphrases for each article, which capture its core idea. For our research, we chose to center on the autonomous vehicle domain, since the research is relevant to our daily lives. We have to convert the PDF versions of most of the research papers into editable types of files such as TXT. This is because most of the research papers are only in PDF format. To test our proposed idea of automating, numerous articles on robotics have been selected. Next, we evaluate our approach by comparing the result with that obtained manually.

Research papers can be retrieved most easily based on their topics. In today's world, it is more necessary than ever to filter out the irrelevant information and gather the interesting information. Almost everybody prefers to spend a short time reading a summary of a topic before deciding whether to engage in further reading. Presently, the majority of people still check documents by hand because the current technology is mainly based on users providing keywords to filter articles. The user would save much time if it were possible to perform automatic checks on the document. Consequently, we have an idea to implement an automated topic extraction method for research papers. Consequently, we have an idea to implement an automated topic extraction method for research papers. This will facilitate the reading process and give the readers a good sense of what the papers are about. This allows them to quickly and easily decide which documents to read. A proven technique for achieving this is topic extraction (also known as key phrase extraction). Research on this topic has been carried out by a large number of researchers. They have published some insightful articles about models and frameworks. For example, in Zhiyuan et al (2010)Ã¢ÂÂs work, the authors propose two approaches for topic extraction: supervised and unsupervised approaches. Turney's work illustrates the supervised principle by providing a model for determining if a topic should be considered a key topic. An online digital library search engine offers this type of extraction. Human labeling is an inconvenience with this approach. It means that the users are required to come up with their own keywords, which are then compared to the whole database to see if any labels are found. However, if the purpose is to collect a large number of articles, the user will have to spend considerable time ensuring that the results are actually focused on his keywords instead of just briefly mentioning them several times. This requires a supervised approach because of the time-consuming nature of the unsupervised principle. The graph-based ranking algorithms, as suggested by Mihalcca and Tarau, have gained a lot of attention and have proven successful in the supervised setting. Based on recursively computing information from the entire graph, this approach can be used to determine the relative importance of vertexes within a graph. The most common uses of these algorithms are to analyze citations, social networks, and web links. Therefore, topic extraction cannot be used to summarize the text's concept, which is its major limitation. Here, we propose a method based on n-gram analysis to automate the topic extraction process and make it more efficient and reliable. To filter out irrelevant results, we create semi-customized blacklists and whitelists to make the process more efficient. after ngram analysis. We also take an adequate number of training samples to ensure the quality of our blacklist and whitelist. Our automated approach will also be evaluated with the aid of a manual process to determine its effectiveness and accuracy. The objective of our study is to help educators properly label selected documents so that they can decide if this is the right topic for them. The topic extraction process should also be fully automated. It means the reader should be able to identify the topic in the shortest amount of time, and the topic should be delivered automatically to the reader. 1.2 Research Objective As a result, we propose an integrated strategy to automate topic extraction automation by analyzing N-grams with the help of blacklists and whitelists, and subsequent labeling of each document based on the results. The aimthis is to develop a practical solution for automating article topic extraction from a large number of articles. The application works well in assisting scholars or any person interested in finding an article they desire from an abundance of articles. By analyzing the results of automatic and manual topic extraction methods, researchers can ensure they are selecting unique keyphrases for each article, which capture its core idea.
