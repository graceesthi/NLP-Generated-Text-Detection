Abstract Recent research in opinion mining proposed word embedding-based topic modeling methods that provide superior coherence compared to traditional topic modeling. In this paper, we demonstrate how these methods can be used to display correlated topic models on social media texts using SocialVisTUM, our proposed interactive visualization toolkit. It displays a graph with topics as nodes and their correlations as edges. Further details are displayed interactively to support the exploration of large text collections, e.g., representative words and sentences of topics, topic and sentiment distributions, hierarchical topic clustering, and customizable, predefined topic labels. The toolkit optimizes automatically on custom data for optimal coherence. We show a working instance of the toolkit on data crawled from English social media discussions about organic food consumption. The visualization confirms findings of a qualitative consumer research study. SocialVisTUM and its training procedures are accessible online. Introduction Web sources, such as social networks, internet forums, and customer reviews from online shops, provide large amounts of unstructured text data. Along with the steady development of new platforms and the increasing number of internet users, the interest in methods that automatically extract the expressed opinions along with the corresponding topics and sentiments in text data has increased in recent years. Scholars and organizations from different fields can utilize such methods to identify patterns and generate new insights. Examples are opinion researchers investigating current opinions on political and societal issues, consumer researchers interested in consumersÃ¢ÂÂ beliefs about the consumption and production of goods (Danner et al., 2020), and marketing managers curious about the public perception of their products and services (Berger et al., 2020; Murphy et al., 2014). (Kirchhoff, 2019) These domain-specific use cases are of interest for research disciplines which taken by itself are not directly related to natural language processing (NLP). Consequentially, there is a constant need to provide state-of-the-art NLP methods such that domain researchers from other fields can take advantage of them. The requirements therefore are simple usage, automatic hyperparameter optimization, minimal effort for manual labeling of text data, and built-in visualizations to give an abstract overview of the discussed topics and their relation with each other. While these practical requirements are important for domain experts, modern opinion mining approaches target specific machine learning objectives. Recently, there is a trend towards unsupervised neural methods for opinion target detection. Attention-based aspect extraction (ABAE) enables clustering of short review texts with significantly higher coherence as traditional LDA-based topic modeling, and it gives 70% F1 score for classification (He et al., 2017). This is improved recently (Karamanolakis et al., 2019; Angelidis and Lapata, 2018; Luo et al., 2019), which underlines the recent impact and potential of related techniques. However, these have not been utilized for visualizations based on correlated topic modeling (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), where all pairs of topics Ã¢ÂÂareÃ¢ÂÂ analyzed to determine if two topics generally tend to occur in the same texts of a given dataset. Thus, the similarity between topics can be defined. This is successfully used to connect topics (nodes) among each other based on their correlations (edges) leading to more abstract and more meaningful meta topics (graph-clusters) which additionally improves topic coherence. Consequentially, these meta topics, e.g., company-related events or research subdisciplines (Liu et al., 2014; Maiya and Rolfe, 2014), can be successfully identified by graphbased visualization techniques. However, there is a lack of related prototypes on texts discussing consumption related issues in product reviews or social media. To the best of our knowledge, there is also no related integration of sentiment analysis into a system available for potential end users, i.e., domain experts. As according text data from customers is available on a large scale in social media, this can be considered as a shortcoming in the field. To address all denoted issues, we propose the SocialVisTUM toolkit, a new visualization and labeling tool to give users a comprehensible overview of the topics discussed in social media texts. It integrates a neural method for unsupervised sentence and comment clustering based on word vectors and attention. We denote the respective clusters as topics hereafter. In addition, we provide a graphbased visualization showing the topics as labeled nodes and the correlation between them as edges. A force-directed graph layout maintains readability even while many relevant topics and topic relations are displayed. (Kirchhoff, 2019) In our interactive graphical user interface, the number of topics displayed and the correlation threshold required to display a connection between two topics can be dynamically adjusted. Further, contextual topic informationprovided, such as the number of respective topic occurrences in the social media texts as node diameter, the correlation between the topic occurrences as edge width, example sentences from the data for each topic, a list of representative words for each topic, and the regarding sentiment distribution of a topic. The regarding sentiment distribution method optimizes automatically on custom data for optimal coherence. We show a working instance of the toolkit on data crawled from English social media discussions about organic food consumption. The visualization confirms findings of a qualitative consumer research study. SocialVisTUM and its training procedures are accessible online.
