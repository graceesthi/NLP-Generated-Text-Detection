Abstract Finnish is a language with multiple dialects that not only differ from each other in terms of accent (pronunciation) but also in terms of morphological forms and lexical choice. We present the first approach to automatically de- tect the dialect of a speaker based on a dialect transcript and transcript with audio recording in a dataset consisting of 23 different dialects. Our results show that the best accuracy is re- ceived by combining both of the modalities, as text only reaches to an overall accuracy of 57%, where as text and audio reach to 85%. Our code, models and data have been released openly on Github and Zenodo. Introduction We present an approach for identifying the dialect of a speaker automatically solely based on text and on audio and text together. We compare the uni- modal approach to the bimodal one. There are no previous dialect identification approaches for Finnish. There are several situations were a dialect identification method can be of use. For example, if we have ASR models fine tuned for specific di- alects, the dialect identification from audio could be used as a preprocessing step. The model could also be used to label recorded materials automatically in order to create archival metadata. In order to make our contribution useful for others, we have released our code, models and processed data openly on GitHub1 and Zenodo2. Finnish is a large Uralic language that is one of the official languages of Finland, and is used essen- tially at all levels of the modern society. There are approximately five million Finnish speakers. The language belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family, and is very closely related to Kare- lian, MeaÃÂnkieli and Kveeni, and is also closely re- lated to the Estonian language. It is more distantly related to numerous Uralic languages spoken in Russia. The history of written Finnish starts in the 16th century. Current orthography is connected to this written tradition, which developed into the current form in the late 19th century with a conscious plan- ning and systematic development of the lexicon. After this, the changes have been minor (HaÃÂkkinen, 1994, 16), and also impacted lexicon, especially what it comes to the development of the vocabu- lary of the modern society and traditional agrarian terminology becoming less known. The Finnish spoken language, however, is still largely based on Finnish dialects. In the 20th cen- tury some of the strongest dialectal features have been disappearing, but there are still clearly dis- tinguishable spoken vernacular varieties that are regionally marked. It has been shown that instead of clear disappearance of dialects there are vari- ous features that are spreading, but not at uniform rate, and reportedly younger speakers use the are- ally marked features less than the older speakers (Lappalainen, 2001, 92). Finnish vernaculars also represent historically rather different Finnic vari- eties, with major split between Eastern and Western dialects. There are, however, also dialect continu- ums and traditionally found gradual differentiation from region to region. Many of the changes have been lexical due to technical innovations and modernization of the society: orthographic spelling conventions have largely remained the same. Spoken Finnish, on the other hand, traditionally represents an areally di- vided dialect continuum, with several sharp bound- aries, and many regions of gradual differentiation from one municipality to another municipality. As mentioned, in the later parts of the 20th cen- tury relatively strong dialect leveling has been tak- ing place. Some of the Finnish dialects may already be concerned endangered, although the complex re- lationship between contemporary vernaculars and the most traditional dialectal forms makes this hard to ascertain. Dialect leveling in itself is a process known from many parts of Europe (Auer, 2018). However, in the case of Finnish the written stan- dard has remained relatively far from the spoken Finnish, besides individual narrow domains such as news broadcasts were the written form is used also in speech. Additionally there have been distinct text col- lections that include materials from this dialect archive. These include dialect books specific regions and municipalities, such as Oulun mur- rekirja [Dialect Book of Oulu] (PaÃÂaÃÂkkoÃÂnen, 1994) or Savonlinnan seudun murrekirja [Dialect book of Savonlinna region] (Palander, 1986). There have also been more recent larger collections that contains excerpts from essentiallydialects (LyytikaÃÂÃÂinen et al., 2013). Especially in the later parts of 21th century the spoken varieties have been leveling away from very specific local dialects, and although regional vari- eties still exist, most of the local varieties have certainly became endangered. Similar processes of dialect convergence have been reported from dif- ferent regions in Europe, although with substantial variation (Auer, 2018). In the case of Finnish this has not, however, resulted in merging of the written and spoken standards, but the spoken Finnish has remained, to our day, very distinct from the written standard. In a late 1950s, a program was set up to document extant spoken dialects, with the goal of recording 30 hours of speech from each municipal- ity. This work resulted in very large collections of dialectal recordings (LyytikaÃÂinen, 1984, 448-449). Many of these have been published, and some por- tion has also been manually normalized. Dataset used is described in more detail in Section 3 Data. In Finnish linguistics the dialect identification has primarily been studied in the context of folk linguistics. In this line of research the perceptions of native speakers are investigated (Niedzielski and Preston, 2000). This type of studies have been done for Finnish, for example, by MielikaÃÂinen and Palander (2014), RaÃÂsaÃÂnen and Palander (2015) and Palander (2011). It has been possible to suggest for individual dialects which features are the most stable and will remain as local regional markers, and which seem to be in retention (RaÃÂsaÃÂnen and Palander, 2015, 25). In this study we conduct just individual experiments and report their results, but in the further research we hope the results could be analyzed in more detail in connection with the earlier dialect perception studies, as we believe the differences in perceived dialect differences could be compared to the difficulties and successes the model has to differentiate individual varieties. Related work The current approaches to Finnish dialect have fo- cused on the textual modality only. Previously, bi- directional LSTM (long short-term memory) based models have been used to normalize Finnish di- alects to standard Finnish (Partanen et al., 2019) and to adapt standard Finnish text into different dialectal forms (HaÃÂmaÃÂlaÃÂinen et al., 2020). Similar approach has also been used to normalize historical Finnish (HaÃÂmaÃÂlaÃÂinen et al., 2021; Partanen et al., 2021). The closest research to our paper conducted for Finnish has been detection of foreign accents from audio. Behravan et al. (2013) have detected for- eign accents from audio only by using i-vectors. However, foreign accent detection is a very differ- ent task to native speaker dialect detection. Many foreign accents have clear cues through phonemes that are not part of the Finnish phonotactic system, where as with dialects, all phonemes are part of Finnish. There have been several recent approaches for Arabic to detect dialect from text (Balaji et al., 2020; Talafha et al., 2020; Alrifai et al., 2021). Textual dialect detection has been done also for German (Jauhiainen et al., 2018), Romanian (Za- haria et al., 2021) and Low Saxon (Siewert et al., 2020). The methods used range from traditional machine learning with features such as n-grams to neural models with pretrained embeddings, as it is typically the case in NLP research. None of these approaches use audio, as they rely on text only. At the same time, North Sami dialects have been identified from audio by training several models, kNNs, SVMs, RFs, CRFs, and LSTM, based on ex- tracted features (Kakouros et al., 2020). Kethireddy et al. (2020) use Mel-weighted SFF spectrogram to detect spoken Arabic dialects. Mel spectograms are also used by Draghici et al. (2020). All these approaches are mono-modal and use only audio. Based on our literature review, the existing ap- proaches use either text or audio for dialect detec- tion. We, however, use both modalities and apply them on a language with no existing dialect detec- tion models. Conclusions We have presented the first model for Finnish di- alect classification for a relatively large number of different dialects, 23 in total. Based on our ex- periments,text only model is not as effective in dialect classification as a model with text and audio. It is clear that the amount of data alone is not the only variable that constitutes a high performance of the model for a given dialect, but also how dis- tinctive a given dialect is from other dialects. Text and audio create interesting dialect vari- eties because they are the modalities for identifying dialects automatically solely based on text and on audio and text together. We present the first approach to automatically de- tect the dialect of a speaker based on a dialect transcript and transcript with audio recording in a dataset consisting of 23 different dialects. Our results show that the best accuracy is re- ceived by combining both of the modalities, as text only reaches to an overall accuracy of 57%, where as text and audio reach to 85%. Our code, models and data have been released openly on Github and Zenodo.
