Abstract Most of existing extractive multi-document summarization (MDS) methods score each sentence individually and extract salient sen- tences one by one to compose a summary, which have two main drawbacks: (1) neglect- ing both the intra and cross-document relations between sentences; (2) neglecting the coher- ence and conciseness of the whole summary. In this paper, we propose a novel MDS frame- work (SgSum) to formulate the MDS task as a sub-graph selection problem, in which source documents are regarded as a relation graph of sentences (e.g., similarity graph or discourse graph) and the candidate summaries are its sub- graphs. Instead of selecting salient sentences, SgSum selects a salient sub-graph from the relation graph as the summary. Comparing with traditional methods, our method has two main advantages: (1) the relations between sentences are captured by modeling both the graph structure of the whole document set and the candidate sub-graphs; (2) directly out- puts an integrate summary in the form of sub- graph which is more informative and coher- ent. Extensive experiments on MultiNews and DUC datasets show that our proposed method brings substantial improvements over several strong baselines. Human evaluation results also demonstrate that our model can produce significantly more coherent and informative summaries compared with traditional MDS methods. Moreover, the proposed architec- ture has strong transfer ability from single to multi-document input, which can reduce the resource bottleneck in MDS tasks. Introduction Currently, most extractive models treat summariza- tion as a sequence labeling task. They score and select sentences one by one (Zhong et al., 2020). These models (called sentence-level extractors) do not consider summary as a whole but a combina- tion of independent sentences. This may cause incoherent and redundant problem, and result in a poor summary even if the summary consists of high score sentences. Some works (Wan et al., 2015; Zhong et al., 2020) treat summary as a whole unit and try to solve the weakness of sentence- level extractors by using a summary-level extrac- tor. However, these models neglect the intra and cross-document relations between sentences which also have benefits for extracting salient sentences, detecting redundancy and generating overall coher- ent summaries. Relations become more necessary when input source documents are much longer and more complex such as multi-document input. In this paper, we propose a novel MDS frame- work called SgSum which formulates the MDS task as a sub-graph selection problem. In our frame- work, source documents are regarded as a relation graph of sentences (e.g., similarity graph or dis- course graph) and the candidate summaries are its sub-graphs. In this view, how to generate a good summary becomes how to select a proper sub- graph. In our framework, the whole graph structure is modeled to help extract salient information from source documents and the sub-graph structures are also modeled to help reflect the quality of candidate summaries. Moreover, the summary is considered as a whole unit, so SgSum directly outputs the final summary in the form of sub-graph. By capturing relations between sentences and evaluating sum- mary as a sub-graph, our framework can generate more informative and coherent summaries com- pared with traditional extractive MDS methods. We evaluate SgSum on two MDS datasets with several types of graphs which all significantly im- prove the MDS performance. Besides, the hu- man evaluation results demonstrate that SgSum can obtain more coherent and informative summaries compared with traditional MDS methods. Moreover, the experimental results also indicate that Sg- Sum has strong power on transfer ability when only trained on single-document data. It performs much better than several strong MDS baselines including supervised and unsupervised models. The contributions of our work are as follows: We propose a novel framework called SgSum which transforms MDS task into the problem of sub-graph selection. The framework lever- ages graph to capture relations between sen- tences, and generates more informative and coherent summaries by modeling sub-graph structures. Due to the graph-based multi-document en- coder, our framework unifies single and multi- document summarization and has strong trans- fer ability from SDS to MDS task without any parallel MDS training data. Thus, it can re- duce the resource bottleneck in MDS tasks. Our model is general to several well-known graph representations. We experiment with similarity graph, topic graph and discourse graphtwo benchmark MDS datasets. Re- sults show that SgSum has achieved superior performance compared with strong baselines. Conclusion We propose a novel framework SgSum which trans- forms the MDS task into the problem of sub-graph selection. SgSum captures the relations between sentences by modelling both the graph structure of the whole document set and the candidate summaries. By capturing relations between sentences individually and extracting salient sen- tences from among them, SgSum can extract salient sen- tences from among the whole document set and compose a summary. Re- sults show that SgSum has achieved superior performance compared with strong baselines.
