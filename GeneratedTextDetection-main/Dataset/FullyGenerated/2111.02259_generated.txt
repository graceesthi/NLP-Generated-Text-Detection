Abstract: User-generated content from social media is produced in many languages, making it technically challenging to compare the discussed themes from one domain across different cultures and regions. It is relevant for domains in a globalized world, such as market research, where people from two nations and markets might have different requirements for a product. We propose a simple, modern, and effective method for building a single topic model with sentiment analysis capable of covering multiple languages simultanteously, based on a pre-trained state-of-the-art deep neural network for natural language understanding. To demonstrate its feasibility, we apply the model to newspaper articles and user comments of a specific domain, i.e., organic food products and related consumption behavior. The themes match across languages. Additionally, we obtain an high proportion of stable and domain-relevant topics, a meaningful relation between topics and their respective textual contents, and an interpretable representation for social media documents. Marketing can potentially benefit from our method, since it provides an easy-to-use means of addressing specific customer interests from different market regions around the globe. For reproducibility, we provide the code, data, and results of our study. INTRODUCTION Topic modeling on social media texts is difficult, since lack of data as well as spelling and grammati- cal errors can make the approach unfeasible. Dealing with multiple languages at the same time adds more complexity to the problem which oftentimes makes the approach unusable for domain experts. Thus, we propose a cross-lingually pre-trained deep neural network as a black box with very little textual pre- processing necessary before embedding the texts and forming their clustering and topic distributions. For our method, we leverage current research regarding multi-lingual topic modeling, see Section 2. We provide an extensive description of a simple method to support domain experts from specific so- cial media domains in its application in Section 3. We qualitatively demonstrate our topic model, its fea- sibility, and its cross-lingual semantic characteristics. on English and German newspaper and social media texts in Section 4. We aim at inspiring pragmatic ideas to explore the potential for comparative, inter- cultural market research and agenda setting studies. Unsolved problems and future potential are given in Section 5. RELATED WORK Topic modeling is meant to learn thematic structure from text corpora. With probabilistic topic model- ing methods, such as latent semantic indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990) or latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), researchers try to extend the capabilities of topic modeling for application from a single language to multiple languages. Using multi- lingual dictionaries and translated corpora is an intu- itive way to tackle cross-lingual topic modeling prob- lems (Zhang et al., 2010; Vulic ÃÂ et al., 2013). Further examples exist for topic modeling with either dictio- naries or translation text collections (Gutie ÃÂrrez et al.,2016; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2012; Jagarlamudi and Daume ÃÂ, 2010). However, this puts dependence on the availability of dictionary or good quality of transla- tions. Significant manual labor and verification are required to prevent deteriorating noise. Recently, methods converting words to vectors according to their semantics are widely adopted (Mikolov et al., 2013). Several studies showed text embeddings improve topic coherence (Bianchi et al., 2020; Srivastava and Sutton, 2017). Regarding multi- linguality, embeddings in word level and sentence level enable text in different languages to be projected to the same vector space (Cer et al., 2018) such that semantically similar texts are clustered together in- dependently of their languages. This favors studies on multi-lingual topic modeling without relying on dictionaries and translation (Xie et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2018). Although providing highly coherent top- ics, a recreation of word spaces is required when new text corpora are introduced. In our scenario, these limitations are not present. Regarding the application of topic modeling, vari- ous social media corpora are studied by domain ex- perts (Tsur et al., 2015; Ko et al., 2018). They covered different domains, such as politics, market- ing, and public health. Regarding media agenda set- ting, (Fieldal., 2018) studied on how much degree a Russian newspaper related to economic downturn. They also ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂintroduced embedding-based methods for cross-lingually projecting English frame to RussianÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ based on Media Frames Corpus. In contrast, we pro- pose a straightforward topic modeling method with- out fine-tuning but only clustering necessary on a so- cial level. To demonstrate its feasibility, we apply the topic model to newspaper articles and user comments of a specific domain, i.e., organic food products and related consumption behavior. The themes match across languages. Additionally, we obtain an high proportion of stable and domain-relevant topics, a meaningful relation between topics and their respective textual contents, and an interpretable representation for social media documents. Marketing can potentially benefit from our method, since it provides an easy-to-use means of addressing specific customer interests from different market regions around the globe.
