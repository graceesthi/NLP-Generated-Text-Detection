Abstract This work explores the capacities of character- based Neural Machine Translation to translate noisy User-Generated Content (UGC) with a strong focus on exploring the limits of such ap- proaches to handle productive UGC phenom- ena, which almost by definition, cannot be seen at training time. Within a strict zero- shot scenario, we first study the detrimental impact on translation performance of various user-generated content phenomena on a small annotated dataset we developed, and then show that such models are indeed incapable of han- dling unknown letters, which leads to catastrophic translation failure once such characters are encountered. We further confirm this be- havior with a simple, yet insightful, copy task experiment and highlight the importance of reducing the vocabulary size hyper-parameter to increase the robustness of character-based models for machine translation. Introduction. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models fall far short from being able to translate noisy User- Generated Content (UGC): the quality of their translation is often even worse than that of a traditional phrase-based system (Khayrallah and Koehn, 2018; Rosales NuÃÂnÃÂez et al., 2019). In addi- tion to ambiguous grammatical constructs and pro- fusion of ellipsis, the main difficulty encountered when translating UGC is the high number of out- of-vocabulary tokens (OOVs) resulting from mis- spelled words, emoticons, hashtags, mentions, and all specific constructs used in online forums and social medias (Foster, 2010; Seddah et al., 2012; Eisenstein, 2013; Sanguinetti et al., 2020). Some of those phenomena can be perceived as noise while the others are typical markers of language variation among speakers. Moreover, a certain amount of those same phenomena operate at the lexical level (either at the character, subword or word levels) (Sanguinetti et al., 2020). This is why, focusing more on the noise axis, char-based mod- els appear to offer a natural solution to this prob- lem (Luong and Manning, 2016; Ling et al., 2015): indeed these open vocabulary models are designed specifically to address the OOV problem. In this work, we explore the ability of out-of- the-box character-based NMT models (Lee et al., 2017) to address the challenges raised by UGC translation. While character-based models may seem promising for such task, to the best of our knowledge, they have only been tested either on data sets in which noise has been artificially added through sampling an edited word error data set (Be- linkov and Bisk, 2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2018a) and on canonical data set, in which they prove to be very effective for translating morphologically-rich languages with a high number of OOVs (Luong and Manning, 2016). However, our starting-points experiments show that character-based systems are outperformed by BPE models even when translating noisy UGC. To understand this counter-intuitive result, we con- duct several experiments and analyses. In partic- ular, we manually annotated 400 sentences at the token level using a fine-grained typology, to per- form our analyses. These sentences correspond to the worst and the best translated utterances of two MT systems (a char-based and a transformer-based model). Our results highlight the extreme sensi- bility of character-based models to the vocabulary size, a parameter often overlooked in the literature. Using a simple set of experiments, we thus show that these models are unable to perform an easy copy task due to their poor handling of unknown and rare characters. By adjusting the vocabulary size parameter, we drastically improve the robust- ness of our character-based model without causing a large drop in in-domain performance. Our contributions are as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we provide an annotated data set that enables in-depth evaluations of the impact of UGC idiosyncrasies; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we demonstrate that char-based neural machine translation models are extremely sensi- tive to unknown and rare characters on both synthetic data and noisy user-generated content; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we show how an overlooked hyper-parameter drastically improve char-based MT models ro- bustness to natural noise while maintaining the in-domain level of performance. Conclusion We showed that in zero-shot scenarios, char-based models are not robust to UGC idiosyncrasies. We presented several experiments that explained this counter-intuitive result by an over-sensibility of these models to the vocabulary size. We demonstrated that drastically lowering this param- eterthe robustness of our char-based models when facing noisy UGC while maintaining almost the same level of performance for in-domain and out-of-domain canonical datasets. Interestingly, we noticed a lack in the literature regarding the importance of vocabulary considerations when training character-based NMTmodels.
