Abstract Identifying and understanding underlying sentiment or emotions in text is a key component of multiple natural language processing applications. While simple polarity sentiment analysis is a well-studied subject, fewer advances have been made in identifying more complex, finer-grained emotions using only textual data. In this paper, we present a Transformer-based model with a Fusion of Adapter layers which leverages knowledge from more simple sentiment analysis tasks to improve the emotion detection task on large scale dataset, such as CMU-MOSEI, using the textual modality only. Results show that our proposed method is competitive with other approaches. We obtained state-of-the-art results for emotion recognition on CMU-MOSEI even while using only the textual modality. Introduction Sentiment analysis is a subject that has long interested multiple researchers in the domain of natural language understanding. It is a task which aims to identify sentiment polarity for a given signal, which can be of the audio, visual or textual modality. Emotion recognition is a related task which consists of assigning more fine-grained labels, such as anger, joy, sadness, etc. This work focuses on analyzing textual inputs. The ability to recognize the sentiment or emotion behind a given sentence or paragraph can lead to multiple applications, such as empathetic dialogue agents and tools to assess the mental state of a patient. While sentiment analysis in the form of assigning polarities (positive, negative, and sometimes neutral) to text data is a task that is often studied and for which adequate results have already been obtained for multiple datasets, identifying finer-grained labels such as specific emotions is still a challenge. In addition to the task complexity, in most datasets available for this task, some emotions are much less represented than others, making the training data unbalanced. To address this issue, the model proposed in this work combines knowledge from less complex tasks and is trained using methods to counteract class imbalance. It is based on a Transformer-based model with a Fusion of Adapter layers to leverage knowledge from the more simple sentiment analysis task. The results obtained are competitive with state-of-the-art multi-modal models on the CMU-MOSEI dataset (Bagher Zadeh et al., 2018), while only utilizing the textual modality. Our main contribution can be formulated as: • We designed a method that capitalizes on both pretrained Transformer language models and knowledge from complementary tasks to improve on the emotion recognition task, whilst using Adapter layers that require less training parameters than the conventional fine-tuning approach and taking into account class imbalance. Prior Works and Background There are multiple approaches that have been used to solve text-based sentiment analysis and emotion detection tasks, namely rule-based and machine learning approaches. Rule-based approaches consist of creating grammatical and logical rules to assign emotions and use lexicons to assign emotions or polarities to words. Previous works using this approach include the ones of Udochukwu and He (2015), Tan et al. (2015) and Seal et al. (2019). These methods are limited by the size and contents of the lexicon used and by the ambiguity of some keywords. Most recent methods are based on the machine learning approach were the network is trained to learn the relationships between words and emotions. Methods such as those proposed by Abdul- Mageed and Ungar (2017), Tang et al. (2015) and Ma et al. (2019) use recurrent neural networks to solve sentiment analysis tasks to break down sentences and understand the relationship between the succession of words and sentiments or emotions. Since the release of pretrained models, recent works (Park et al., 2019; Acheampong et al., 2021) have been focused on fine-tuning transformer models, which have consistently outperformed previous methods thanks to the multi-head attention applied on words. To improve previous textual emotion recognition methods, we believe that in addition to transfer learning, multi-task learning and class imbalance should be considered. 2.1 Transfer Learning Transfer learning is a method where the weights of a model trained on a task are used as starting point to train a model for another task. The use of transfer learning with pretrained models has been, for the past few years, the way to obtain state-of-the-art results for multiple natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Transformer-based pretrained models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019c), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019), etc. have been dominating the field over previously used methods. 2.2 Multi-Task Learning Multi-task learning is used to train one model to solve multiple tasks instead of fine-tuning separate models. Multiple approaches have been used to solve multi-task learning problems. Liu et al. (2019a) proposed a Multi-Task Deep Neural Network (MT-DNN) with a shared transformer encoder and task-specific heads. Clark et al. (2019) and Liu et al. (2019b) presented a new training procedure based on knowledge distillation to improve the performances of the MT-DNN. These approaches allow the model to learn a shared representation between all tasks. Houlsby et al. (2019) introduced a new model architecture using task-specific adapter layers and keeping the weights of the pretrained encoder frozen. This method, while preventing task interference and catastrophic forgetting, does not allow to transfer knowledge between tasks. To counter this weakness, Pfeiffer et al. (2020a) proposed AdapterFusion, a way to combine knowledge from multiple adapters. 2.3 Class Imbalance Class imbalance is a challenge in resolving many artificial intelligence tasks. It occurs when one or multiple classes make up significantly less samples of the data than the majority class or classes, often leading to a poor predictive performance for those minority classes. Classic approaches to this problem include re-sampling minority class samples or weighting the loss function according to class frequency. In the field of computer vision, Lin et al. (2018) proposed a modified version of the cross-entropy loss called the focal loss to handle imbalance. Conclusion The model presented in this work surpasses state-of-the-art results for emotion recognition on CMU- MOSEI even while using only the textual modality. There is still improvement needed for the rarer emotions in the dataset, but at of the time of producing this article, the results presented are substantially stronger than other contributions in terms of F1-scores. Due to the lack of large-scale datasets for emotion detection in text, testing the model on purely textual data will have to be done in further studies as the data will become available.
